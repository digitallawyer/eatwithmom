Originally from a cookbook distributed by the Belgian Woman Farmers Union (De Boerinnenbond), this easy and fast waffle recipe has always been a staple at our home.


**Ingredients**

* 500g self rising flour
* 1/2l milk
* 6 eggs
* 200g sugar
* 150g butter
* 2 packets of vanilla sugar

**Preparation**

Mix flour, milk and egg yolk. Add the melted butter, the sugar, the vanilla sugar and finally the stiffened egg whites. Bake the dough in a waffle iron until it is light brown. The waffles can be served with whipped cream, in which case you can lower the amount of sugar in the dough.
